# Basic 4-Chord Progression Builder
==================================

### What's It Do?
----------------
Built in JavaScript.

This program will come up with 4 chords randomly, in the form of Roman Numerals.
The progression could be:
* Major
* Minor

#### Types of Progressions
    - "Bouncy" Alternating Descending (transitional bounce not repeated)
    - "Bouncy" Alternating Ascending (transitional bounce not repeated)
    - Ascending (by one or two scale degrees)
    - Descending (by one or two scale degrees)

##### Future Additions:
Randomly choosing if the progression should have a substitute chord (chords?) inserted:
    - Borrowed Chord
    - Secondary Dominant
    - Tritone Substitution

Expand to 6 or 8 chords.
